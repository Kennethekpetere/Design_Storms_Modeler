# Design_Storms_Modeler
This script uses the Natural Resource Conservation (NRC) methodologies to simulate design storms. Users are prompted to input precipitation depth based on a specified duration, and then it produces a synthetic hyetograph as the output. 
The motivation for developing this script was to distribute a Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) depth at duration into a synthetic hyetograph. 
These PMPs were stochastically derived using IMERG satellite data with a combination of the WMO's PMP technique.
